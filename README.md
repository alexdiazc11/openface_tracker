### installation:

1. follow https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/wiki/Unix-Installation for Dependencies (for ubuntu 16.04 follow instructions for 14.04)

2. Since some of ROS Kinetic libraries are not linked with GCC versions >= 5.X (http://answers.ros.org/question/234322/linker-error-on-ros-kinetic-ubuntu-1604/), we now us clang. if you don't have clang installed just run:

```
$ sudo apt-get install clang
```


>if you have GCC version < 5.X and you don't want to compile with clang, juste comment these lines in CMakelists.txt:

>```
>set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "clang++")
>set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "clang")
>```

3. openface_tracker is a ROS pakage, assuming you already have a catkin workspace (http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace):

```
$ cd (your catkin_ws)/src && git clone https://github.com/chili-epfl/openface_tracker.git
```
```
$ cd .. && catkin_make
```
```
$ catkin_make install
```

### usage:

```
$ roslaunch openface_tracker/openface_tracker.launch
```

You can specify the camera device you want to use (0 by default). If you want to use an external camera (# 1):
```
$ roslaunch openface_tracker/openface_tracker.launch camera_device_arg:=1
```

You can also specify if you want or not display the tracking. (you may not want to display the tracking if you run an experiment with subjects that can see the monitor)
By default, the parameter ("show_tracking_arg") is "true". If you dont want to display:
```
$ roslaunch openface_tracker/openface_tracker.launch show_tracking_arg:=false
```
